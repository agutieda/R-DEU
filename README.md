# Random Discounted Expected Utility

Code to replicate the empirical results reported in the paper **"*Random
Discounted Expected Utility*"** by Jose Apesteguia, Miguel A. Ballester, and
Ángelo Gutiérrez-Daza.

This repository contains the following folders:

1. "**DMPL**": contains the code to reproduce the results reported in Section 4
   of the paper where the application of the R-DEU model to Double Multiple
   Price Lists (DMPL) data is presented.

2. "**CB**": contains the code to reproduce the results reported in Section 6 of
   the paper where the application of the R-DEU model to Convex Buget (CB) data
   is presented.

3. "**Extensions**": contains the code to reproduce the results reported in the
   section "Extensions" of the Appendix, where the model is extended to allow
   for present bias that is also stochastic.

Further information of the contents of each folder and the steps necessary to
reproduce the results is available in the README.md file of each folder.
