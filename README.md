# Random Discounted Expected Utility

Code to replicate the empirical results reported in the paper  **"*Random
Discounted Expected Utility*"** by Jose Apesteguia, Miguel A. Ballester, and
Ángelo Gutiérrez-Daza.

This repository contains the following folders:

1. **DMPL** contains the code to reproduce the results reported in Section 4 of
   the paper, which presents the application of the R-DEU model to Double
   Multiple Price Lists (DMPL) data.

2. **CB** contains the code to reproduce the results reported in Section 6 of
   the paper, where the application of the R-DEU model to Convex Budget (CB)
   data is presented.
3. **Extensions** contains the code to reproduce the results reported in the
   section "Extensions" of the Appendix, where the model is extended to allow
   for present bias that is also stochastic.

The README.md file of each folder contains further information about the
contents and the steps necessary to reproduce the results.
